# Machine Learning for Energy Poverty Detection Using Smart Meter Consumption Patterns


 **Using machine learning to identify energy-poor households through privacy-preserving analysis of 167 million smart meter observations from the Low Carbon London dataset. Achieved 87.8% recall with XGBoost classifier.**

---

##  Project Overview

This project addresses the critical challenge of **identifying energy-poor households** in the UK, where approximately 3.16 million homes (13% of English households) experience fuel poverty. Traditional identification methods rely on income surveys that are:

- **Expensive and time-consuming** (12-18 months lag)
- **Privacy-invasive** (require sensitive financial information)
- **Limited in geographical detail** (small area estimation challenges)
- **Operationally complex** for energy suppliers and local authorities

This research demonstrates how **smart meter analytics** can provide:

✅ **Privacy-preserving detection** - No income data required  
✅ **Scalable identification** - Process millions of households  
✅ **Timely insights** - Near real-time detection capability  
✅ **High recall** - 87.8% of energy-poor households identified

##  Research Context

### The Energy Poverty Challenge

Energy poverty affects health, wellbeing, and climate goals:

- **Health Impact**: ~25,000 excess winter deaths annually in England and Wales
- **Economic Cost**: NHS spends £1.36 billion/year treating cold-home-related illnesses
- **Social Impact**: Households face impossible choices between heating and eating
- **Climate Context**: Net-zero transition must protect vulnerable households

### Research Questions

1. Can smart meter consumption patterns reliably identify energy-poor households?
2. Which features best predict energy poverty without income data?
3. How do we balance model performance with ethical considerations?
4. What are the implications for privacy-preserving social analytics?

##  Key Results

### Model Performance (XGBoost)

```
Classification Metrics:
├── Recall:      87.8%  ← Successfully identifies energy-poor households
├── Precision:   81.3%  ← Among flagged households, 81.3% are truly poor
├── Accuracy:    86.2%  ← Overall classification performance
└── ROC-AUC:     0.912  ← Strong discrimination capability
```

### What This Means

**For every 1,000 households:**
- 300 are energy-poor (30% prevalence)
  - ✅ 263 correctly identified (87.8% recall)
  - ❌ 37 missed (12.2% false negative rate)
- 700 are not energy-poor
  - ✅ 586 correctly identified
  - ⚠️ 114 incorrectly flagged (16.3% false positive rate)

### Ethical Considerations

**Why prioritize recall over precision?**

- **False Negatives are More Harmful**: Missing a vulnerable household means continued hardship without support
- **False Positives are Manageable**: Incorrectly flagged households can be verified through follow-up
- **Social Cost-Benefit**: Better to cast wider net in screening phase
